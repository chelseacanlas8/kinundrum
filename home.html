                    Anatomy requires a lot of memorizing, but that's not all there is to it. You need to be able to apply your knowledge to real-life scenarios.</p>

                    <h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <h3>Kinundrum: a problem-based application for undergraduate kinesiology education</h3>
                    <p>Kinundrum is a collaborative endeavour created by Chelsea Canlas, Natividad Chen and Patricia Nguyen for their Masters Research Project in the UofT Biomedical Communications graduate program. The faculty supervisory committee includes Dr. Judi Laprade, Michael Corrin, Dr. Jodie Jenkinson, Dr. Shelley Wall, and Dr. Derek Ng.</p>

                    <p>Designed to address the need for an e-learning tool that engages undergraduate kinesiology students in active learning, Kinundrum guides students through lower limb biomechanics case studies at increasing levels of difficulty. Case studies present animated injury scenarios, after which students solve interactive problems accompanied by 3D models, animations, and illustrations of the affected anatomy.</p>

                    <p>At the intersection of art, science, education, and technology, Kinundrum combines problem-based learning pedagogy with multimedia design and web technology to create an engaging e-learning tool that can be accessed outside of the formal classroom.</p>
